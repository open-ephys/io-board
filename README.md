io-board
========

Description
-----------------
Need to sync your neural data with external triggers? Use this board to connect up to 8 digital inputs to the acquisition board. Since its internal components are completely passive, the I/O board can be also be used to relay digital outputs and analog inputs.

Time to build: 1 hour

Specifications
-------------------
- 8 vertical BNC terminals
- HDMI type A connector

File types:
--------------
- .ai = Adobe Illustrator files; contain images of hardware
- .brd = EAGLE board files; describe the physical layout of the printed circuit board
- .sch = EAGLE schematic files; describe the electrical connections of the printed circuit board
- .cam = EAGLE export files; contain instructions for translating between the .brd file and Gerber files
- BOM.txt = Bill of Materials; contains part numbers for all components (from DigiKey unless otherwise specified)
- .md = Markdown files; most likely a README file; can be viewed with any text edtior
- "gerber" files (.top, .bsk, .oln, etc.) = contain machine-readable instructions for creating the printed circuit board; these are sent to a fab house (such as Sunstone Circuits) for PCB production
- .SLDPRT files = SolidWorks part files; contain CAD models of 3D components
- .STL files = stereolithography files; can be sent to a rapid prototyping service (such as Shapeways) to create 3D objects
- .eps file = encapsulated postscript files; describe the shape of laser-cut parts (Ponoko only). Can be edited in Adobe Illustrator.
